<b>Minecraft</b> requires a player to gather resources in order to survive, build, <a href="https://www.apple.com">apple computer</a>, and advance through the game. Because of the different environments found in Minecraft, a player needs to use different strategies to efficiently gather resources in the three major areas of the game â€” the Overland, the Mines, and the Nether. Once these are mastered, you will have the resources necessary to advance through all aspects of Minecraft game play including crafting, building, experimenting with redstone, and even brewing potions.
  <p style="color:#FF0000">In Minecraft, the majority of survival gameplay takes place in the extensive biomes found in the Overland. There, you collect resources that you use to survive and thrive throughout the game.</p>
 <center>Move to friendly biomes such as <i>savannas</i> or plains. Some biomes are very hostile to new players including the desert, though it offers great resources later in gameplay. If you spawn in a resource scarce biome, simply begin travelling until you find a more suitable habitat.</center>
